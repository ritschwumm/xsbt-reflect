An sbt plugin to reflect build properties into source code.
This plugin is mostly for demonstration purposes,
for real-world usage you probably want sbt-buildinfo.

To build this code, get and install SBT from
    https://github.com/sbt/sbt

Build and publish the plugin:
    git clone git@github.com:ritschwumm/xstb-reflect.git
    cd xsbt-reflect
    sbt publish-local

Add the plugin to your project in project/plugins.sbt:
    addSbtPlugin("de.djini" % "xsbt-reflect" % <version>)

Include the plugin in your project's build.sbt:

	enablePlugins(ReflectPlugin)
	
Optionally set package- and class name:
    reflectPackage  := "my.package"
    reflectClass    := "ReflectBuild"

With this setup, you can access the name and version of your project
from scala as my.pack.Reflected.name and my.pack.Reflected.version .
