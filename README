An sbt plugin to reflect build properties into source code

To build this code, get and install SBT from 
    https://github.com/sbt/sbt

Build and publish the plugin:
    git clone git@github.com:ritschwumm/xstb-reflect.git
    cd xstb-reflect
    sbt publish-local
    
Add the plugin to your project in project/plugins.sbt:
    addSbtPlugin("de.djini" % "xsbt-reflect" % <version>)
    
Include the plugin in your project's build.sbt:

    reflectPackage  := "my.pack"
    
    reflectClass    := "Reflected"
    
    sourceGenerators in Compile <+= reflect map identity

With this setup, you can access the name and version of your project
from scala as my.pack.Reflected.name and my.pack.Reflected.version .
