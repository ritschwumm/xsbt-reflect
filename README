An xsbt plugin to reflect build properties into source code.

To build this code, get and install SBT from 
    https://github.com/harrah/xsbt

Build and publish the plugin:
    git clone git@github.com:ritschwumm/xstb-reflect.git
    cd xstb-reflect
    sbt publish-local
    
Add the plugin to your project in project/plugins/build.sbt:
	addSbtPlugin("de.djini" % "xsbt-reflect" % "0.0.3")
    
Include the plugin in you project's build.sbt:

	seq(ReflectPlugin.allSettings:_*)
	
	reflectPackage	:= "my.pack"
	
	reflectClass	:= "Reflected"
	
	sourceGenerators in Compile <+= reflect map identity

With this setup, you can access the name and version of your project
from scala as my.pack.Reflected.name and my.pack.Reflected.version .
